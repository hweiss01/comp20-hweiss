Hayley Weiss Assignment 2 part 1

1. I used the sprite sheet and the drawImage() function to draw
the required images onto the webpage.  Since an image needs to be loaded before
it can be used in drawImage, I used 

sprite.onload = function() { .. }

and put my drawImage lines in here, as recommended. 

Also, when I opened my file in Google Chrome it looked exactly how I wanted it
to. But when I opened it in Firefox, there was a strip of blue sky at the 
bottom of the canvas, making it look like the dirt didn't fully cover the sky,
even though this didn't appear in Chrome. And when I opened it in Safari, it 
only showed the rectangles I drew for the sky and the ground, and my first
drawImage(), which is of the tree. None of the other drawImage() commands show
up. I posted on Piazza and changed my code to what I wrote above as advised. 
But the error still persists. I'm hoping you can tell me what I did wrong!

2.  I didn't work with anyone

3. It took about 3 hours.
