	<h1> ScoreCenter Security Report </h1>
	<p> Prepared by Hayley Weiss </p>
	
	<p>This security assessment tests the 2048-Game Center created by fellow student Daniel Kim for Comp20 assignment 4. This assignment's requirements were that the developer create a web application that maintains a scoreboard of high scores for the players of 2048, such that multiple users can submit and retrieve scores. Users are also able to search for scores by unique username. However, the developer left many security risks in the product that make it inappropriate to release to the public. This assessment attempts to identify and outline some of these vulnerabilities present and show solutions as to how to prevent them.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>Initially, I performed "black-box" testing, which consisted of attempting to hack the application with what is only available from outside, as in without access to the source code. I made use of the simple tool curl to perform POSTs, and toyed with URI arguments to test the GETs.</p>
	<p> Then, I examined the source code and looked for vulnerabilities there that could be exploited. </p>

	



	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<ol>

		<li> <h3> Script Injection </h3>
			<p> This effects the GET API </p>
			<p> This is a severe issue, as the application doesn't handle data correctly and opens users to information attacks </p>
			<p> When using the POST API, the data is not escaped and thus client can include JavaScript or HTML in place of the username. Thus, when the GET API is accessed, these pieces of code will activate and can effect what the client sees. For example with the curl command: </p>
			<img src = "../CURL.png" alt="curl snapshop" />
			<p> A popular meme character will show up in place of a username </p>
			<img src = "../XXS.png" alt="dog" />
			<p> This can be resolved by checking and escaping user input before storing the data and filtering out dangerous characters. </p>
		</li>
		<li> <h3> CORS without validation </h3>
			<p> This effects all the APIs of the application, due to the nature of the issue </p>
			<p> This is a severe issue, as it allows any site access to the application </p>
			<p> The developer enabled Cross Origin Resource Sharing by means of using "*", or the universal allow. This means that any URL is able to gain access to the application. Similarly, the code opens up every API to CORS, instead of just the APIs that require CORS to function. </p>

			<img src = "../CORS.png" alt="CORS snapshot"/>
			<p>This issue can be resolved by either validating reponses, or using some means of authentication to check the credentials of a server, possibly through the "withCredentials" property on "XMLHttpRequest". </p>
		</li>
