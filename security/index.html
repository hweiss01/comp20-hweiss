	<h1> ScoreCenter Security Report </h1>
	<p> Prepared by Hayley Weiss </p>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This assessment looks to test the security of the 2048-GameCenter created by Daniel Kim for Tufts Comp20, or Web Programming. The application was developed to offer a gaming center to keep track of the high scores for the highly addicting game, 2048. The application provides an API that allows other developers to retrieve their own scores.It also consists of an interface allowing users to see all the high scores, as well as the scores from a particular user. However, security was not a part of the assignment and thus there are many vulnerabilities that make this application currently unfit for the public.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>Initially, I performed "black-box" testing, which consisted of attempting to hack the application with what is only available from outside, as in without access to the source code. I made use of the simple tool curl to perform POSTs, and toyed with URI arguments to test the GETs.</p>
	<p> Then, I examined the source code and looked for vulnerabilities there that could be exploited. </p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>fds</p>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<ol>
		<li> <h3> Script Injection </h3>
			<p> This effects the GET API </p>
			<p> This is a severe issue, as the application doesn't handle data correctly and opens users to information attacks </p>
			<p> When using the POST API, the data is not escaped and thus client can include JavaScript or HTML in place of the username. Thus, when the GET API is accessed, these pieces of code will activate and can effect what the client sees. For example with the curl command: </p>
			<img src = "/..CURL.png" alt="curl snapshop" />
			<p> A popular meme character will show up in place of a username </p>
			<img src = "/..XXS.png" alt="dog" />
		</li>
		<li> <h3> CORS without validation </h3>
			<p> This effects all the APIs of the application, due to the nature of the issue </p>
			<p> This is a severe issue, as it allows any site access to the application </p>
			<p> The developer enabled Cross Origin Resource Sharing by means of using "*", or the universal allow. This means that any URL is able to gain access to the application. Similarly, the code opens up every API to CORS, instead of just the APIs that require CORS to function. </p>

			<p>This issue can be resolved by either validating reponses, or using some means of authentication to check the credentials of a server, possibly through the "withCredentials" property on "XMLHttpRequest". </p>
