	<h1> ScoreCenter Security Report </h1>
	<p> Prepared by Hayley Weiss </p>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This assessment looks to test the security of the 2048-GameCenter created by Daniel Kim for Tufts Comp20, or Web Programming. The application was developed to offer a gaming center to keep track of the high scores for the highly addicting game, 2048. The application provides an API that allows other developers to retrieve their own scores.It also consists of an interface allowing users to see all the high scores, as well as the scores from a particular user. However, security was not a part of the assignment and thus there are many vulnerabilities that make this application currently unfit for the public.</p>
