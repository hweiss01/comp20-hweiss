This repository holds all of the work I created for comp20, Web Programming, 
at Tufts University.

My favorite project/lab was the status_updates lab.

I'm most proud of the transit project, because I felt that was the assignment
in which I had to do the most work and write a lot of my own code for it to
work.

I think I learned a lot from this class. I went in with little HTML5 and 
javascript knowledge, and came out with not only knowing those languages, but
a whole lot more useful technologies for web programming!
