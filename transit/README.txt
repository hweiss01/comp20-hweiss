README.txt

I think I have implemented everything correctly. The only weird parts are that the image I chose as the unique marker isn't being scaled down to an appropriate size. On the guides you sent on how to use the googlemaps API it said the image would be scaled for me.

Also, for the red line, the connecting polyline is a little weird because the red line doubles back on itself a little on the map, and in my JSON list of the stations. I didn't know what to do to fix that.

I think it took me about 6 hours to complete this? And I didn't work with anyone, though I found the examples you posted online and did in class to be extremely useful.
